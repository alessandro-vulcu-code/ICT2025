# IoT System Architecture
## Communication Paradigms
- **Client/Server**: sources explicitly know the destination of their messages.
- **Publish/Subscribe**: sources publish to a logical channel; interested destinations subscribe (one-to-many, no explicit sessions).
- Typical IoT traffic flows:
    - **Asynchronous events** (uplink)
    - **Periodic or on-demand measurements** (uplink)
    - **Commands** from processing platforms (downlink)

## Properties of an IoT System
- **Trustworthiness**: availability, resilience, confidentiality, integrity, safety.
- **Architectural**: composability, modularity, heterogeneity, scalability, legacy support, shareability, unique identification.
- **Functional**: accuracy, auto-configuration, context-awareness, big data management, discoverability, real-time, self-description, compliance.

## Standard Reference Model
- **Physical Entity Domain (PED)**: monitored physical objects.
- **Sensing & Controlling Domain (SCD)**: sensors, actuators bridging physical ↔ cyber world.
- **Operations & Management Domain (OMD)**: OSS + BSS for provisioning, assurance, optimization.
- **Resource Access & Interchange Domain (RAID)**: service interfaces with access policies.
- **Application & Service Domain (ASD)**: end-user services via APIs or portals.
- **User Domain (UD)**: human/digital users via devices (PCs, smartphones, control panels, smart glasses)

## Network Architectures
- **One-level**: endpoints use full IP stack (e.g., cellular).
- **Two-level (1b)**: endpoints resource-constrained, gateway manages protocols (LPWA, Low Power Wide Area: LoRa, SigFox, NB-IoT). *Target of the course*
- **Two-level (1c)**: endpoints support TCP/IP, traffic managed by router (Ethernet/Wi-Fi)



---

## WANs
- TCP/IP networks, shared among users.
- Public by nature.
- **VPNs**: reserved bandwidth/security for defined groups, with private IP addressing
- Users outside of a group cannot communicate directly with users of the group.
- Use private IP addressing and private routing protocol instances.

---

## Topologies
- **Bus**: every nodes taps into a shared medium (CSMA/CD), collisions possible.
- **Ring**: token-based, eliminates collisions, requires token management.
- **Star**: master/slave, predictable, not scalable (master bottleneck).
- **Mesh**: full or partial, robust, private, many physical links

# Endpoints

## Sensors
- Devices detecting stimuli → electrical/processable output.
- Types: pressure, temperature, biometric, chemical, acoustic, optical, positioning, etc.
- Three classifications:
	- **Fixed**: stable, not moving like domotics
	- **Mobile**: always moving (GPS, wearables)
	- **Nomadic**: they move but then they stop somewhere else (portable medical devices, field sensors)
- **Active vs Passive** sensors
