# Internet of Things (IoT)

The **Internet of Things (IoT)** refers to the integration of information about physical objects into the Internet. In other words, even trivial everyday items—such as thermometers, parking spots, or watches—can now connect and interact online.

The key idea is to make computing **ubiquitous and invisible to users**: IoT devices work without requiring explicit user actions. Instead, they rely on sensing, rules, and automated responses to environmental conditions.

A well-known definition by Kevin Ashton, who coined the term _Internet of Things_, captures the essence:

> _In the twentieth century, computers were brains without senses – they only knew what we told them.  
> In the twenty-first century, because of the Internet of Things, computers can sense things for themselves._

## Definitions of IoT

Several organizations provide complementary definitions:

- **General definition**: “A global infrastructure for the information society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting physical and virtual things based on interoperable communication technologies”.
    
- **IEEE**: “A network of items — each embedded with sensors — which are connected to the Internet”.
    
- **ITU**: “Available anywhere, anytime, by anything and anyone”.
    
- **IETF**: IoT connects electronic, electrical, and even non-electrical objects to provide contextual services, enabled by technologies such as RFID, sensors, and actuators.
    
- **NIST**: Defines IoT as a form of **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)**, connecting smart devices in sectors like transport, energy, manufacturing, and healthcare.
    
- **W3C**: Stresses the role of web technologies in the _Web of Things_, where physical objects and their virtual counterparts can interact via HTTP, REST, and JavaScript APIs.
    

A more **formal and precise definition** emphasizes that:

- _No IP means no IoT._ Devices must be addressable through IP, ideally IPv6.
    
- IoT is the paradigm in which every “thing” (real or virtual) is assigned an IP address and can be reached via the standard Internet Protocol stack.

## Functional Overview of IoT

IoT systems can be described in terms of four main functions:

1. **Sensing (Data Collection)**
    
    - Sensors act as the interface between the physical and digital world, producing data.
        
    - Collection modes include:
        
        - **Periodic** (regular sampling),
            
        - **On-demand** (upon request),
            
        - **Event-driven** (alerts when conditions are met).
            
    - Data must be enriched with **metadata** (type, location, context, structural relationships).
        
2. **Processing and Visualization**
    
    - Processing can be:
        
        - **Control loops** (simple, real-time adjustments to reach a setpoint),
            
        - **Analytics & machine learning** (based on historical data and patterns).
            
    - Typical processing steps: sampling, aliasing, quantization, hysteresis, calibration, error propagation, optimization, and prediction.
        
    - Results are often presented in **dashboards** or as a **digital twin** of the system.
        
3. **Acting**
    
    - The ultimate goal of IoT is action: applying insights to the physical world.
        
    - Actions may be:
        
        - Direct (automatic actuation, e.g., switch on AC if temperature > threshold),
            
        - Indirect (recommendations to operators, process optimization).
            
    - IoT also helps identify anomalies and trigger corrective actions.
        
4. **System Overview**  
    IoT architecture is typically layered:
    
    - **Sensors** → collect data
        
    - **Gateways (Edge/Fog nodes)** → aggregate, filter, and connect to the wider Internet (via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LoRa, NB-IoT, etc.)
        
    - **Cloud** → large-scale processing, ML/AI, visualization, and storage
        
    - **Applications** → services improving quality of life in multiple domains.

## Applications of IoT

IoT improves life quality across many sectors:

- **Industry 4.0 (Industrial IoT)**:
    
    - Safety improvements, predictive maintenance, energy management, supply chain optimization, and data-driven decision-making.
