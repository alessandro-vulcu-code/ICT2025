### Spectrum

- Spectrum is a limited resource (interference, collision, etc.).
- Necessary measures to ensure efficient and fair use of this resource.
- Controlled and owned by the State, that is responsible to provide geography-based regulations for the use of the spectrum.

#### Unlicensed spectrum
- Also referred to as **Instrumental, Scientific, and Medical (ISM)** bands.
- It is available to any number of customers, but with no exclusive rights.
- **Target:** applications which are not lucrative enough to justify the cost of licence, but prove valuable if considered collectively.
	- Notable examples: **Wi-Fi**, **Bluetooth**, etc.
- **Unlicensed does not mean unregulated** → there are still some rules to avoid/minimize interference, and to promote fair use of resources.
	- Some regulation mechanisms: **ERP limits**, **LBT**, **duty cycle**, etc.
	- Regulations are not necessarily aligned in all the Regions of the world, but there are some levels of superimposition (e.g., **2.4 GHz ISM band** for Wi-Fi).

#### Unlicensed spectrum in Europe: ERP

- At the European level, spectrum is regulated by the **European Commission (EC)**, **Electronic Communications Committee (ECC)**, and the **European Telecommunications Standard Institute (ETSI)**.
- Different rules/limitations are defined.
- **Effective Radiated Power (ERP):** it evaluates the emissions of a device.
- It is related to the **Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP)**, defined as the power that would have to be used on an isotropic antenna in order to get the same field strength that the tested device produces at the same distance.
- We have that **ERP = EIRP – 2.15.**

---

#### Unlicensed spectrum in Europe: LBT

- **Listen Before Talk (LBT):** a radio transmitter first senses its radio environment before it starts a transmission.
- The device continuously monitors channels to transmit only when a channel is not in use.
- For a device to transmit its data (talk), it needs to ensure that the channel is free (listen).
- **How to monitor/sense the channel?**
    - **Energy detection:** The receiver measures the received power in the band of interest over a sensing interval. If the measured energy exceeds a predefined threshold, the channel is considered busy.    
    - **Layer-2 frame decoding:** The receiver tries to detect and decode known structures in the frame. If a valid preamble or header is detected, the channel is declared busy.

---

#### Unlicensed spectrum in Europe: DC

- **Duty Cycle (DC):** it is defined as the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the maximum transmitter “on” time over one hour, relative to a one hour period.
- These limitations apply to every receiver, excluding those with LBT capabilities.
- **1% DC:** the max. transmission time of any device is 1% of an hour (i.e., 36 seconds in an hour).

### Short-range

#### Introduction
- **Short-range:** (generally) cell diameter smaller than 100 m.
- Does not support mobility/handover.
- Can be classified according to the reach of the radio link:
    - **Vicinity and proximity networks**, from a few cm to ~2–3 m.
    - **Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs)**, up to ~10 m.
    - **Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)**, up to ~100 m.
- Are sometimes referred to as **Low-Rate WPAN.**

# Radio Frequency: IDentification (RFID) and NFC

## RFID

### Overview
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a method for remotely storing and retrieving data through **RFID tags** and **readers**.  
Tags store information that readers can access wirelessly and automatically. Tags can be **WORM (Write Once Read Many)** or **rewritable**, and may integrate other sensors.  
Advantages include no line-of-sight requirement and automated data exchange. However, privacy concerns exist regarding data tracking and misuse.

---

### How It Works
RFID tags have embedded chips storing information that can be rewritten.  
When a reader emits a radio signal, the **tag’s coil** couples inductively with the reader’s coil, transferring energy (a form of **wireless power transfer**).  
The tag uses this energy to respond, enabling data exchange over variable distances.
![[Pasted image 20251014084153.png]]
https://youtu.be/-Wf7aadxBkE?si=e7GMOLnfuQ8he80f

---

### Near-field Coupling
The coupling between tag and reader happens in the **near-field region**, meaning the distance must be much smaller than the signal wavelength (≈15% of it).  
Operating at lower frequencies increases the wavelength, thus expanding the working distance:
- At **2.4 GHz**, λ ≈ 0.13 m → range ≈ 20 cm  
- At **13.56 MHz**, λ ≈ 22 m → range ≈ 3 m

---

### Tags Visualized
![[Pasted image 20251014085031.png]]
RFID tags typically include an **antenna** and an **integrated circuit (chip)**.  
The antenna captures electromagnetic energy from the reader, while the chip stores and processes information.  
Different tag designs exist depending on frequency range, application, and power type (active, semi-passive, passive).

---

### Applications
RFID systems are widely used for:
- **Security**: identification cards, passports  
- **Access control**: Telepass, metro cards  
- **Retail and logistics**: tracking merchandise, inventory, pallet management  
- **Ticketing and sports**: electronic ticket systems, race tracking  
- **NFC in smartphones**: contactless interactions  

Readers can monitor entries/exits or track specific tagged items for process monitoring.

---

### Applications: Passport
Since 2006, **RFID tags have been embedded in British and U.S. passports**.  
They store printed information (including a **digital photograph**) and consist of:
- A **microchip** containing personal data  
- A **tag antenna** for communication  
- A **substrate** to hold components together  
These **biometric passports** allow for faster and more secure identity verification.

---

### Applications: Metro Card
Metro systems use **RFID cards** to manage balances securely through cryptographic protection.  
When a passenger enters or exits a station, the reader updates the card balance locally:
- **Entry:** records time and station  
- **Exit:** calculates fare and updates balance  
Readers periodically sync with a central server for auditing, lost card tracking, and balance verification.  
Users can also check balances online.

---

### Applications: Merchandise in Stores (1/3)
RFID tags in retail enable:
- **Data storage:** more information than barcodes, editable anytime  
- **Quality control:** tracking goods from production to storage  
- **Speed:** read multiple tags simultaneously at a distance  
- **Inventory management:** automatic product location and stock updates  
- **Durability:** resistant to handling and environmental stress  

Common example: **clothing RFID tags**.

---

### Applications: Merchandise in Stores (2/3)
RFID supports **anti-theft** and **authenticity verification**.  
When an unpaid item passes through security gates:
- The **transmitter**’s radio waves induce a current in the tag’s antenna.
- The tag emits a secondary signal at a specific frequency.
- The **receiver** detects this and triggers an alarm.  

**Note:** Security gates are tall to enhance detection field coverage.

---
### Applications: Merchandise in Stores (3/3)
At checkout, **RFID tags are deactivated** to prevent theft or false alarms.  
A **deactivation pad** disables the electronic components in the tag, ensuring they no longer emit signals when exiting the store.  
This system reduces human error and enhances automatic theft prevention.
![[Pasted image 20251014085939.png]]
- Tall for work in small proximity
- EAS systems use **inductive or resonant antennas**, which form a field that depends on coil size and geometry.  The **larger the antenna**, the more uniform and “deep” the detection zone can be across a wide doorway.  
	- Tall vertical antennas give:
		- better sensitivity at the top and bottom,
		- less dead zone near the middle,
		- higher signal-to-noise ratio.

---

### RFID vs. Barcode
| Feature | RFID | Barcode |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Rate | Thousands simultaneously | One at a time |
| Range | Up to a few meters | ~6 meters |
| Speed | Very fast (milliseconds) | Slow |
| Line-of-sight | Not required | Required |
| Identification | Unique per item | Item type only |

RFID is thus superior for automation, scalability, and inventory tracking.

---

### Electronic Product Code (EPC)
The **EPCGlobal** consortium (founded in 2003) standardized RFID operation.  
The **Electronic Product Code (EPC)** uniquely identifies any physical object across the world.  
Key aspects:
- Encodes product and manufacturer info.
- Accessible through **EPC Information Services (EPCIS)** via **web services** (SOAP, WSDL).
- Enables global traceability for logistics and retail applications.

---
### Electronic Product Code (EPC) Structure
The EPC is composed of several fields:
- **Header (8 bits):** defines the partitioning scheme (up to 256 instances)  
- **EPC Manager (28 bits):** manufacturer ID (>268 million instances)  
- **Object Class (24 bits):** product type (>16 million instances)  
- **Serial Number (36 bits):** unique identifier for each item (>68 billion instances)  

This structure guarantees a **globally unique ID** for every item, across all manufacturers and time.

---

### Types of Tag
RFID tags differ by **power source** and **functionality**:
- **Semi-passive:** contain a small battery activated by reader signals; typical lifespan 3–5 years. Used in temperature or environmental sensors.  
- **Active:** have a dedicated battery for continuous transmission, allowing **longer range** and **richer data** (e.g., Telepass, asset tracking, personnel tags).  

Applications include **cold-chain logistics**, **warehouse monitoring**, and **vehicle tracking**.

---

### Active Tag: Telepass
Telepass uses **Active RFID** at around **5.8 GHz** (microwave frequency).  
When the vehicle enters a toll gate:
1. Roadside sensors emit a microwave signal to wake nearby devices.  
2. The in-car transponder activates and sends its **unique ID**.  
3. The system verifies the ID in the database and opens the barrier if authorized.  

Active RFID ensures **fast, reliable, and long-distance** communication.

---
### Types of Tag (Passive)
**Passive RFID tags** have no internal battery and rely on energy transmitted by the reader.  
They are extremely **low-cost** and used in most RFID applications today.  
- **Low Frequency (LF):** 120–140 kHz  
- **High Frequency (HF):** 13.56 MHz (ISM band)  
- **Ultra-High Frequency (UHF):** 433, 860–960 MHz (depending on region)  
- **Microwave:** 2.4–5.8 GHz and millimeter-wave bands  

They provide short communication ranges but are ideal for access control, retail, and ticketing systems.

---

### Passive Tag Types
Two main standards define range and operation:
- **Vicinity (ISO/IEC 15693):** range up to 1–1.5 m  
- **Proximity (ISO/IEC 14443):** range up to 2–10 cm  

Features:
- Strong resistance to interference and unwanted readings  
- Commonly used in **ticketing**, **contactless payments**, and **access control**  
Transmission includes a **bitstream** and a **CRC** for data integrity checking.

---

### Passive Tag (PHY Layer)
Since passive tags are simple, they use **amplitude-based modulation**:
- **Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK):** carrier amplitude varies to represent bits  
  - High amplitude → bit 1  
  - Low amplitude → bit 0  
This scheme allows the tag to decode data while harvesting energy from the same signal.
![[Pasted image 20251014093810.png]]

---
### Passive Tag (PHY Layer) — On-Off Keying (OOK)
**On-Off Keying (OOK)** is a simplified version of ASK with only two amplitude levels:
- “ON” (full amplitude) represents bit 1  
- “OFF” (zero amplitude) represents bit 0  

Advantages: very simple implementation.  
Drawbacks:  
- Lower data rate than ASK (only 2 levels)  
- The tag’s power supply depends on signal amplitude; long sequences of 0s cause the tag to receive no energy, possibly turning it off and forcing a restart.

![[Pasted image 20251014093827.png]]

---

### Passive Tag (PHY Layer) — Pulse Interval Encoding (PIE)
Passive tag communication must balance data transmission and power delivery.  
**Pulse-Interval Encoding (PIE)** keeps the signal at full power most of the time:
- A **short power-off pulse** after a long power interval → bit 1  
- A **shorter power interval** after the same off pulse → bit 0  

This ensures the tag receives energy even during long streams of 0s.  
As a result, **data rate depends on bit patterns** (0s transmit faster than 1s).
![[Pasted image 20251014094743.png]]

---

### Passive Tag (MAC Layer)
MAC design is challenging due to potentially **thousands of tags** and limited tag intelligence.  
- If one reader → no need for complex MAC.  
- Multiple readers → interference must be managed.  
Tags cannot use advanced techniques like carrier sensing or RTS/CTS.  

Two major anti-collision protocols:
1. **Slotted ALOHA:** tags transmit after random backoff times.  
2. **Binary Tree Resolution:** the reader queries subsets of tags by partial ID patterns until only one tag responds.
