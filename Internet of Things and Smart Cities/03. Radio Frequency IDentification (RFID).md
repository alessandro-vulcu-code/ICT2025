### Spectrum

- Spectrum is a limited resource (interference, collision, etc.).
- Necessary measures to ensure efficient and fair use of this resource.
- Controlled and owned by the State, that is responsible to provide geography-based regulations for the use of the spectrum.

- **Licensed spectrum**: allocation of spectrum resources to private companies (e.g., cellular network operators) upon concession fees (auctions).
	- In Italy, 5G spectrum auction in 2018: 6.5 B€  [https://www.corrierecomunicazioni.it/telco/5g/chiusa-lasta-5g-incasso-oltre-i-65-miliardi/](https://www.corrierecomunicazioni.it/telco/5g/chiusa-lasta-5g-incasso-oltre-i-65-miliardi/)
	- It provides the best quality of service for end customers.
    
- **Unlicensed spectrum**: free access to spectrum without any centralized control.
	- _Unlicensed does not mean unregulated._
    
- **“Reserved” spectrum**: for public safety, emergency forces, police, military, …

#### Unlicensed spectrum
- Also referred to as **Instrumental, Scientific, and Medical (ISM)** bands.
- It is available to any number of customers, but with no exclusive rights.
- **Target:** applications which are not lucrative enough to justify the cost of licence, but prove valuable if considered collectively.
	- Notable examples: **Wi-Fi**, **Bluetooth**, etc.
- **Unlicensed does not mean unregulated** → there are still some rules to avoid/minimize interference, and to promote fair use of resources.
	- Some regulation mechanisms: **ERP limits**, **LBT**, **duty cycle**, etc.
	- Regulations are not necessarily aligned in all the Regions of the world, but there are some levels of superimposition (e.g., **2.4 GHz ISM band** for Wi-Fi).

#### Unlicensed spectrum in Europe: ERP

- At the European level, spectrum is regulated by the **European Commission (EC)**, **Electronic Communications Committee (ECC)**, and the **European Telecommunications Standard Institute (ETSI)**.
- Different rules/limitations are defined.
- **Effective Radiated Power (ERP):** it evaluates the emissions of a device.
- It is related to the **Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP)**, defined as the power that would have to be used on an isotropic antenna in order to get the same field strength that the tested device produces at the same distance.
- We have that **ERP = EIRP – 2.15.**

#### Unlicensed spectrum in Europe: LBT

- **Listen Before Talk (LBT):** a radio transmitter first senses its radio environment before it starts a transmission.
- The device continuously monitors channels to transmit only when a channel is not in use.
- For a device to transmit its data (talk), it needs to ensure that the channel is free (listen).
- **How to monitor/sense the channel?**
    - **Energy detection:** The receiver measures the received power in the band of interest over a sensing interval. If the measured energy exceeds a predefined threshold, the channel is considered busy.    
    - **Layer-2 frame decoding:** The receiver tries to detect and decode known structures in the frame. If a valid preamble or header is detected, the channel is declared busy.

#### Unlicensed spectrum in Europe: DC

- **Duty Cycle (DC):** it is defined as the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the maximum transmitter “on” time over one hour, relative to a one hour period.
- These limitations apply to every receiver, excluding those with LBT capabilities.
- **1% DC:** the max. transmission time of any device is 1% of an hour (i.e., 36 seconds in an hour).

#### Unlicensed spectrum in Europe
- Some of the most important ISM sub-bands in Europe (focus on IoT use cases).
- Country specific.

### Short-range

#### Introduction
- **Short-range:** (generally) cell diameter smaller than 100 m.
- Does not support mobility/handover.
- Can be classified according to the reach of the radio link:
    - **Vicinity and proximity networks**, from a few cm to ~2–3 m.
    - **Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs)**, up to ~10 m.
    - **Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)**, up to ~100 m.
- Are sometimes referred to as **Low-Rate WPAN.**
