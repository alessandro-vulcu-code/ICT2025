## Autonomous Driving

- An autonomous vehicle is a car capable of sensing the surrounding environment and taking actions without human intervention.
- These sensors include thermographic cameras, radar, lidar, cameras, GPS, and inertial measurement units.
- The sensors’ output is used as input for a controller that creates a model to identify the most appropriate navigation path.

### Perception

- Autonomous vehicles use different types of sensors to perceive the environment and monitor their own physical parameters:
	- **Cameras:** Capture visual data to recognize objects, lanes, and traffic signs, providing essential information for navigation and decision-making.

	- **LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging):** Uses laser pulses to measure distances, creating 3D maps of the environment for object detection and localization.

	- **RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging):** Utilizes radio waves to detect the position, speed, and direction of objects, useful for long-range detection and adverse weather conditions.

	- **SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging):** Uses sound waves to detect objects and measure distances, commonly used for proximity sensing in close-range environments.

	- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):** Measures the vehicle's acceleration, angular velocity, and orientation, helping to determine its precise position and movement.

	- **GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System):** Provides geospatial data through satellite signals, assisting with precise vehicle localization and navigation.
- Sensor fusion techniques are used to reduce measurement uncertainties due to noise.

## Planning

- Using the data obtained from the perception system, the ego vehicle performs behavior planning.
- The optimal behavior needs to be decided by predicting the states of the ego vehicle as well as other objects in the surroundings.
- Based on the planned behavior, generate an optimal trajectory.
- The entire process is called **motion planning**.

### SAE Levels of Automation

- The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) defined 6 levels of driving automation:
    - **Level 0:** No automation, manual control.
    - **Level 1:** Driver assistance with monitoring functionalities (e.g., cruise control).
    - **Level 2:** Partial automation with the car taking autonomous actions such as steering and acceleration, but the human can always take back control.
	- **Level 3**: Conditional automation, where the vehicle can perform most of the driving task, but human override is still required.
	- **Level 4**: High automation, where the vehicle performs all driving tasks under specific circumstances and in geofenced areas. Human override is still an option.
	- **Level 5**: Full automation, with the vehicle performing all driving tasks in all conditions. No human attention or interaction is required.

### Current State
- Several limitations and barriers could impede the adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs), including:
    - The need for sufficient consumer demand.
    - Assurance of data security and protection against cyberattacks.
    - Regulations compatible with driverless operation and resolved liability laws.
    - Societal attitude and behavior change regarding distrust and subsequent resistance to AV use.
    - The development of economically viable AV technologies.

- **Hacking Autonomous Cars**: A key topic of concern.

### Cruise Control
- Cruise Control (CC) is a system that automatically controls the speed of a motor vehicle.
- It is a servomechanism, i.e., a system that automatically uses error-sensing negative feedback to correct the throttle of the car and maintain a constant speed.
- CC is a simple implementation of a control system that, in control theory, is called proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller.

### Basic Stuff on Control Theory
- A field of engineering and applied math that deals with the control of dynamical systems.
- The objective is to develop a controller, i.e., a device that acts on the system to achieve a desired state.
- The controller monitors the process via a process variable and compares it with a reference or set point.
- The difference between these values is called the error signal.

### Open Loop (Feedforward) Controller
- Compares a value that is not given by the process with the reference input.
- For instance, a boiler that needs to heat the water for a given amount of time.

### Closed Loop (Feedback) Controller
- Compares a value that is given by the process with the reference input.
- For instance, a car’s cruise control or a thermostat.

### PID Controller
- It is a control loop mechanism using feedback to apply continuously modulated control.
- It continuously computes an error as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable.
- Based on the error value, it applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms.

### Control Strategies
- A control system for an autonomous vehicle is broken down into two fundamental components:
  - Longitudinal control: control of the longitudinal motion of the vehicle, with variables being the throttle and brake inputs.
  - Lateral control: control of the lateral dynamics of the vehicle, with variables being the steering inputs to govern the steering angle and heading (two different things).
