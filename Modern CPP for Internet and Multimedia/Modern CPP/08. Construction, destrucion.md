Here is a summary of the first three slides, in markdown code block format:

# Object life cycle
- An object is first constructed, goes through a series of operations, and is then destroyed.
- These operations are closely related, with slight differences in meaning.
- Most operations related to an object's life cycle can be automatically generated by the compiler.

# Life-cycle operations
The complete set of life-cycle operations for class X:
```cpp
class X {
  X(someargs);        // Ordinary constructor
  X();                // Default constructor
  X(const X&);        // Copy constructor
  X(X&&);             // Move constructor
  X& operator = (const X&);  // Copy assignment
  X& operator = (X&&);      // Move assignment
  ~X();               // Destructor
};
````

- The constructor starts the object life cycle, and the destructor ends it.

# Constructors and destructors
- Constructors and destructors are paired actions closely related to the object life cycle.

### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
struct Tracer {
  std::string mess;
  Tracer(const std::string& s) : mess{s} { std::cout << mess; }
  ~Tracer() { std::cout << "~ " << mess; }
};
```

- When the `Tracer` object goes out of scope, the destructor is called and cleans up the resources.

```cpp
int main() {
  Tracer object{"a string"};
}
```

Output:

```
a string
~ a string
```


- The constructor's role is to set up the object, while the destructor ensures that resources are cleaned up.
- **Constructor Characteristics:**
  - Has the same name as the class.
  - Does not have a return type.
  - Establishes invariants that hold throughout the object life cycle.
  - Ensures that class behavior is clear and simplifies member functions.

# Constructor Details
- Invariants must be maintained when copying or moving objects, not just when creating them.
- If the constructor can't enforce invariants (e.g., invalid parameters), it must not create the object.
- When halting construction, ensure that no resources are leaked.

# Destructor - RAII (Resource Acquisition is Initialization)
- Destructor is named `~X` (where X is the class name).
- It cannot take arguments and can only appear once in a class.
- RAII manages resources: the constructor acquires them, and the destructor releases them.
- This method is safer than manual resource management by developers.

### Destructor Example:
```cpp
void f() {
  Tracer tr{"a string"};
}

Tracer* tr = new Tracer{“a string”};
// some code
delete tr;
// more code
```


# Fixed constructor/destructor sequence of calls
- The operations performed by a constructor follow a fixed sequence:
  1. If the class is derived from a base class, the base class constructor is called first.
  2. The constructors of the class's data members are called next.
  3. The constructor body is executed.
  
- The operations performed by a destructor also follow a fixed sequence:
  1. The destructor body is executed first.
  2. The destructors of the data members are called next.
  3. If the class is derived from a base class, the base class destructor is called last.

# Initialization without constructors
- Built-in types (e.g., `int`, `char`) cannot have constructors but can be initialized with values (e.g., `int a{1};`).
- Initialization without constructors also applies to class objects in certain cases:
  1. **Member-wise initialization**: If the members are public, they can be initialized directly.
  2. **Copy initialization**: This involves copying the values of members.
  3. **Default initialization**: Using `{}`, every member is initialized to its default value.

```cpp
struct Work {
  std::string name;
  int number;
};
Work some_work{"Teach", 19};
std::cout << some_work.name << " " << some_work.number;
```

Here is the full translation in English:

---

### **Default Initialization**

When `{}` is used, each member is initialized to its default value (for example, empty strings for `std::string` and `0` for integers).  
**Example**:

```cpp
Work df_work {};
std::cout << df_work.name << " " << df_work.number;  // Output: "" 0
```

### **Copy Initialization**

A new object can be initialized by copying an existing object.  
**Example**:

```cpp
Work other_work{some_work};
std::cout << other_work.name << " " << other_work.number;  // Output: "Teach" 19
```

---

### **Initialization with constructors**

If a constructor is defined, the default constructor is removed.  
**Example of an error**:

```cpp
struct Work {
  std::string name;
  int number;
  Work(std::string a) : name{a} { number = name.length(); }
};
Work some_work {}; // Error: the default constructor is not available
```

**Valid example**:

```cpp
Work other_work{"long_thread"};
std::cout << other_work.name << " " << other_work.number;  // Output: "long_thread" 12
```

---

### **{}: Universal and uniform initialization**

`{}` is used for uniform initialization and to avoid ambiguity.  
It is generally safer to use `{}` instead of `()` for initialization.  
**Example**:

```cpp
X* p = new X{4}; // Correct
X* p2 = new X=4; // Incorrect
```

---

### **Default constructors**

A default constructor is a constructor that can be invoked without arguments.  
A constructor with arguments can become a default constructor by assigning a default value to the arguments.  

**Example**:
```cpp
struct Work {
  Work(std::string a = "work") : name{a} {};
};
```
- Built-in types have default constructors, but they are not automatically invoked for local variables or objects in the free store.

If a class has members of type reference or `const`, they must be initialized in the default constructor.  
In these cases, in-class initializers or a default constructor that initializes them should be used.  

**Example**:
```cpp
struct Work {
  char& flag_ref;
  const char flag{'a'};  // In-class initializer
  Work() { flag_ref{flag}; }  // Default constructor
};
```

---
### **Initializer-list constructors**
A constructor with an argument of type `std::initializer_list<T>` can accept an arbitrary number of homogeneous arguments.
- The list is passed by value, but it is still efficient (since `std::initializer_list<T>` is a small type).
- It has an iterator and immutable values (it does not support move operations).

**Example**:
```cpp
struct X {
  X(std::initializer_list<int>); 
  X();
  X(int);
};

X x0 {};  // Default constructor
X x1 {1}; // Constructor with initializer list
X x2 (1); // Explicit call to X(int) constructor
```

- There are two rules for constructor overload resolution:
    1. If there is ambiguity between a default constructor and one based on an initializer list, the default constructor is used.
    2. If there is ambiguity between a constructor based on an initializer list and an ordinary constructor, the one with the initializer list is used (to avoid different resolutions with a varying number of elements).

**Example**:
```cpp
struct X { 
  X(std::initializer_list<int>); 
  X();
  X(int); 
};

X x0 {};    // Default constructor
X x1 {1};   // Constructor with initializer list
X x2 (1);   // Explicit call to X(int)
```

---

### **Member initialization**
- When an object is constructed, its members must be initialized.
- It is possible to use a member initializer list in the constructor body.
- The member initializer list starts with a colon and calls the constructors of the members before the body of the constructor is executed.

**Example**:
```cpp
ClassName::ClassName(T1 arg1, T2 arg2) : 
  member1{arg1}, 
  member2{arg2} 
{
  // Body of the constructor
}
```

- The constructors of the members are called in the order they are declared in the class definition.
- Member initialization using a member initializer list is more efficient, as it avoids default initialization followed by reassignment in the constructor body.

**Example**:
```cpp
Person::Person(std::string& n, std::string& a) :
  name{n} 
{
  address = a;
}
```

In this example, `address` is initialized to an empty string before being assigned to `a`. It is better to initialize it directly in the member initializer list.

---
### **Delegating constructors**
- If multiple constructors need to repeat the same action, you can:
    1. Duplicate the code (not recommended).
    2. Define a function that is called by all constructors.
    3. Define a constructor in terms of another.
- This approach avoids explicit initialization of other members and respects delegation rules.    

**Example**:
```cpp
ClassName::ClassName(T1 arg1) : ClassName{f(arg1)} {}
```

In this case, the constructor delegates initialization to another constructor.
- A delegating constructor can call another constructor of the same class.

**Example**:
```cpp
class X { 
  int a; 
  void validate(int x) { 
    if (0 < x && x <= max) a = x; 
    else throw Bad_X(x); 
  } 
public: 
  X(int x) { validate(x); } 
  X() { validate(22); } 
  X(std::string s) { int x = to<int>(s); validate(x); }
};
```

In this example, the constructor `X()` calls `X(int)` to avoid code duplication.
Delegating constructors are useful for managing multiple initialization modes in a centralized manner.

**Example**:
```cpp
class X { 
  int a; 
public: 
  X(int x) { 
    if (0 < x && x <= max) a = x; 
    else throw Bad_X(x); 
  } 
  X() : X{22} {}  // Delegates to the X(int) constructor
  X(std::string s) : X{to<int>(s)} {}  // Delegates to the X(int) constructor
};
```

In this example, each constructor delegates to another, centralizing the validation logic.

---
### **Copy**
- The `x = y` copy operation is correct if it satisfies two conditions:
    
    1. **Equivalence**: After `x = y`, any operation on `x` and `y` must yield the same results.
    2. **Independence**: After `x = y`, an operation on `x` should not change the state of `y`.
- C++ provides:
    - **Copy constructor**: `X(const X&)` to initialize a new object by copying the values of another.
    - **Copy assignment**: `X& operator = (const X&)` to assign the values from one object to another already constructed.

**Example**:
```cpp
struct Work {
  std::string name;
  int number;

  Work(const Work & w) : name{w.name}, number{w.number} {}
};
```

- A developer can implement a custom version of the copy constructor and copy assignment operator.
- If not provided, the compiler generates a default copy operation at the member level (member-wise copy).
- However, this can cause problems with objects that have pointer-type members.    

---
### **Shallow copies and shared state**
- If a class has pointers as members, the default copy only copies the pointers, not the values they point to. This creates a shallow copy and **shared state**.
- **Problem**: After copying, any modification to one object will affect the other, as both share the same data.
- A **deep copy** copies the values in memory that the pointers reference, avoiding shared state problems.

**Example**:
```cpp
struct S {
  int* p;
};

void f() {
  S x {new int{0}};  // Creates a new object
  S y {x};           // Copy with shallow copy
  *(y.p) = 1;        // Also modifies x
  std::cout << *(x.p);  // Output: 1
}
```

---

### **Move**
- After `x` is moved to `y`:
    - `y` owns the resources/values that `x` had.
    - `x` is left in a valid state (the destructor can be called, possibly efficiently), but it no longer owns any resources and/or does not have a valid logical state.
- C++ provides:
    - **Move constructor**: `X(X&&)` to take ownership of the resources of the argument while initializing a new object.
    - **Move assignment**: `X& operator = (X&&)`.

**Example**:
```cpp
struct Work {
  std::string name;
  Work(std::string&& n) : name{std::move(n)} {}  // Move constructor
};
```

- The `std::move` function is used to cast an object to an rvalue reference, indicating that it can be moved instead of copied.

- A move operation can be more efficient than a copy because no new resources are acquired.
- For built-in types, a move is essentially the same as a copy.
- The compiler knows when to use a move operation in cases like:
    1. Returning an rvalue from a function.
    2. Using an rvalue reference for function arguments.

**Example**:
```cpp
std::vector<int> v1 {77};  // 1 element with value 77
std::vector<int> v2 = std::move(v1);  // Moves v1's resources to v2
```

---

### **Optimizations with rvalue references**
- **Classic swap function (without rvalue references)**:  
    The old-style swap requires multiple copy operations and results in higher memory consumption.

**Example**:
```cpp
template<class T>
void swap(T& a, T& b) {
  T tmp {a};  // Copy of a
  a = b;      // Copy of b
  b = tmp;    // Copy of tmp (a)
}
```

- This results in **3 copy operations** plus the associated destructors.

---
### **Optimizations with rvalue references (continued)**
- **Optimized swap function (with rvalue references)**:  
    When rvalue references are used, only the necessary move operations occur, reducing the overhead.

**Example**:
```cpp
template<class T>
void swap(T& a, T& b) {
  T tmp {std::move(a)};  // Move a into tmp
  a = std::move(b);      // Move b into a
  b = std::move(tmp);    // Move tmp into b
}
```

- This optimized version only requires **2 moves** and no copies.
- `std::move()` does not actually move anything but casts an object to an rvalue reference, allowing types with move constructors or assignment operators to utilize the move operation.

---

### **Default operations**
- By default, a class has:
    - Default constructor
    - Default copy constructor
    - Default move constructor
    - Default copy assignment
    - Default move assignment
    - Default destructor
    
- A developer can control the generation of these defaults:
    - If a constructor is declared, the default constructor is not generated.
    - If any copy/move/destructor operation is declared, no default copy/move/destructor operations are generated.

**Example**:
```cpp
struct Work {
  Work(const Work&) = delete;  // Disable the default copy constructor
};
```

- It is possible to explicitly request that the compiler generates default operations using the `=default` keyword.
- In general, it is safer to rely on the compiler for default operations rather than writing custom implementations, as it reduces the chance of errors. However, developers must watch out for shallow copies.
- **Default initialization** of built-in type members for local and free-store objects leaves them uninitialized! It's safer to use `{}` to ensure proper initialization.
